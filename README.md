# Reports_Public
This repo contains reports I've written for various undergraduate, research internship, and postgraduate projects.

This includes:

1) MastersThesis_SamWard.pdf (2019/20); Masters project goal was to **search for correlations and measure time lags between multiple sets of time-series data**. I created gamma-ray light curves of accreting supermassive black holes using the all-sky Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. I then used Discrete Cross Correlation Functions (DCCF's) to search for correlations with the radio light curves from the Sub-Millimetre Array. Finally, I exploited Monte Carlo light curve simulations using the Emmanoulopoulos 2013 framework to **compute confidence intervals, and thus measure the significance of inferred time lags**.

2) BScReport_SamWard.pdf (2018/19); BSc project involved **Fourier analysis to fit time-series data** of a pulsating star, measure the properties of a long-term modulation function, and infer physical properties like star temperature and radius. I used a telescope on the roof of the Durham physics department to measure (B,V) time-series data; I fitted the resulting photometry using a Fourier series, and inferred the sine-wave parameters that characterised the long-term evolution or 'Blazhko Modulation'. 

3) UTokyoReport-SamWard.pdf (2018); University of Toyo Research Internship project used **Monte Carlo numerical simulations** to understand the effect of stellar flybys on resonant planetary systems. I built fake planetary systems using the AMUSE software, sent in a rogue star with a random trajectory and velocity, and measured the effect on the planets' orbital periods and semi-major axes.
